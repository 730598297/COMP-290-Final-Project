# COMP 290 Final Project: Project Proposal

What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)
- The project I am creating is a web application designed to assist teachers in teaching math to elementary school students. This web-based app will focus on interactive and engaging content, including math games, visual aids for complex concepts, and tools that support teachers in their curriculum goals. The aim is for it to go beyond being just a supplementary tool; instead, it will be structured to integrate very easily into a teacher's lesson plans. Features like guided activities, progress tracking, and customization options will allow teachers to align the web app's content with their specific educational goals. This platform will make it easier for teachers to engage students with interactive learning methods and adapt the resources to meet various learning needs. By including things like games and visual aids, the website will help simplify challenging math concepts, making learning fun and easy for young students to get hold of. It will have a home screen that will contain three main tabs for teacher, parent, and student, where each tab will have different things. I want to highlight easy readability and easy to use for everyone. I don't want to make it difficult or convoluted because I feel like that would decrease the usage of the website and defeat the entire purpose.

Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?
(Answer with a minimum of 100 words)
- I recently learned that math scores around the world have been declining. One of my first ever personal programming projects was in high school, where I created a math game in Java that ran on a GUI. I want to revisit my idea and expand upon it. I also want to do some form of community service with my programming ability. I can always do the physical, which I have always done growing up, but now that I am able to contribute to my community more than just the physical, I want to help in an aspect that many don't.

Who is the target audience of this app? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)
- The primary target audience for this website is young elementary school students, normally aged 6–10, who are beginning to learn fundamental math concepts. These students would really benefit from interactive learning tools that make math engaging and accessible. The audience also includes elementary school teachers and parents, who play an important role in supporting the learning of children. Teachers and parents will use the website to guide students and track progress, so it should be easy to navigate for adults as well. The site should be able to work for devices commonly found in schools, that includes computers, tablets, and smartphones, as these are widely accessible in schools and homes. Also, it's important to note that some schools provide tablets or use Chromebooks. A well-designed website will allow it to be used easily on any screen size, supporting learning on the go, regardless if the child is at home. In the future, I could possibly make this into some sort of app, but for now, for simplicity's sake, it is planned only to be a website. I would also like to include more difficult math for middle schoolers and high schoolers. This will be beneficial because students will already understand the UI and what to expect.

What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your app?
(Answer with a minimum of 200 words)
- I want to increase literacy with math in young kids around the world. Global math scores are decreasing in many countries, and I want to help stop this. More and more people every day are on the internet, and people are getting on the internet at younger and younger ages. Technology can be used as a tool to help teachers teach complex ideas in an easier manner. I'm hoping to be able to bring math to kids in a visual, fun, and interactive way. I want to make this webpage completely free to use with all its abilities open to the teachers. Teachers do not get paid very well, so to have a paywall to use the service I am providing would defeat the purpose of it being something for the community to use. I feel that in today's world, you are at a massive disadvantage if you do not have access to money, and a way to get there is through a good education. Mathematics is one of the most important subjects that a person can master, so it's crucial to have a good foundation. I want to create a webpage that will help children become better students so they can have a better quality of life.
